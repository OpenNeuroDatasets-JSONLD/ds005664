# San Diego State University Traveling Subjects (SDSU-TS) Dataset

The San Diego State University Traveling Subjects (SDSU-TS) dataset was designed to facilitate the harmonization of MRI data acquired across autism neuroimaging studies conducted at San Diego State University (SDSU). The dataset includes MRI scans from 9 healthy adult participants (aged 22-55 years) collected across 2 sites: SDSU Imaging Center (SDSU-MRI) and Center for Functional MRI at UC San Diego (CFMRI). The scan acquisition protocols represent those used at each site in SDSU autism MRI studies over the last 10-15 years, including:

- 5 diffusion-weighted (3 at CFMRI, 2 at SDSU-MRI)
- 3 T1-weighted (2 at CFMRI, 1 at SDSU-MRI)
- 2 T2-weighted (1 each at SDSU-MRI and CFMRI)

We also acquired diffusion-weighted MRI protocols matching the publicly available Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Lifespan Human Connectome Project (HCP) studies.

## Scan Protocols

The scan protocols acquired at each site are shown below:

### CFMRI (Siemens Prisma 3T)

| Type | Sequence Name           | b-values (s/mm²) [# directions] | TE  | TR  | Res (mm)       |
|------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|-----|-----|----------------|
| dwi  | 2shell93dir (hcp-style)  | 1500 [47]; 3000 [46]           | 89  | 4   | 1.71x1.71x1.7  |
| dwi  | abcd                     | 500 [6]; 1000 [15]; 2000 [15]; 3000 [60] | 82  | 4.1 | 1.71x1.71x1.7  |
| dwi  | 3shell45dir (legacy ms)  | 500 [15]; 1500 [15]; 4000 [15] | 81  | 7   | 1.88x1.88x2.5  |
| dwi  | 1shell61dir (legacy ss)  | 1000 [61]                      | 82  | 8.5 | 1.88x1.88x2    |
| T1w  | mprage                   | n/a                             | 4   | 8.8 | 0.8x0.8x0.8    |
| T1w  | fspgr (legacy)           | n/a                             | 3   | 8.1 | 1x1x1          |

**Note:** 
- TE = Echo time (ms); TR = Repetition time (s).
- Reversed phase-encoding fieldmaps were acquired for all protocols.
- All data were acquired using a 32-channel head coil, except for the legacy sequences at CFMRI, which were acquired using an 8-channel head coil.

All participants were scanned at least once at each site. Additionally, rescan data were acquired in 6 participants at the CFMRI site and 5 participants at the SDSU site. The mean time between scan sessions was 7 days (range: 1-19 days).

The unprocessed MRI data are provided along with participant demographic data.

The imaging data was converted to BIDS using ezBIDS ([https://brainlife.io/ezbids](https://brainlife.io/ezbids)) and custom scripts. All anatomical scans have been defaced using ezBIDS.

## Data Notes

Please note the following:

- The `1shell61dir` data in the `cfmri1` session of subjects `ts001`, `ts002`, and `ts004` were acquired with a variant spatial resolution.
- The `3shell45dir` data in the `cfmri1` session of subject `ts002` was acquired with a variant spatial resolution (2mm instead of 2.5mm slice thickness).
- The quality of the `3shell45dir` data in the `cfmri1` session of subject `ts007` is poor and may not be usable.
